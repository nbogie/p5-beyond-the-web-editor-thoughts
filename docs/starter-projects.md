## (my) starter / template projects

First of all, if you're here from a random search, there are almost certainly much better starter projects out there.

This is mostly a list of my old starter projects, which I'm gathering here just for my reference while i work on updated ones, in case I left some useful wisdom in there for my students or for my future self ;)

## credits

I think in each individual project I've credited any sources used. However big shout out to this [p5 ts starter](https://github.com/Gaweph/p5-typescript-starter) by Gareth Williams (Gaweph) which I think the typescript setups for all my p5 v1.x starters have been based on.
